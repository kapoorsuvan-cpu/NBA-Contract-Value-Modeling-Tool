The NBA Salary Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts professional basketball player salaries based on their performance statistics. Using real data from the 2023-24 NBA season, this project fetches current player statistics from the official NBA API and combines them with authentic salary information to train predictive models. The system analyzes both basic counting stats (points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals) and advanced metrics (Win Shares, EPA, True Shooting Percentage) to understand what drives player compensation in the modern NBA.

The project employs machine learning algorithms to identify patterns between performance and pay, achieving prediction accuracy of approximately 80% (R² score). Beyond just making predictions, the model provides detailed feature importance analysis to reveal which statistics matter most for determining salaries, generates professional visualizations to explore the relationship between performance and compensation, and offers an interactive mode where users can input custom statistics to receive instant salary predictions with confidence intervals.

How It Works:
When you run the program, it first loads the real salary data from the included CSV file containing 438 NBA players from the 2023-24 season. The program then connects to the NBA's official statistics API to fetch current season performance data for all active players, including their per-game averages and shooting percentages. Since the CSV contains only last names while the API returns full names, the system uses intelligent matching that compares both last names and team affiliations to successfully match approximately 300+ players between the two datasets.

Once the data is merged, the program calculates advanced metrics that aren't directly available from the API. Win Shares are computed using a simplified formula that considers offensive contributions (points, assists, made field goals) and defensive contributions (steals, blocks, rebounds) while penalizing inefficiency from missed shots. The EPA (Estimated Plus/Minus Achievement) metric is calculated by weighing various statistics according to their impact on team performance. These advanced metrics, combined with the basic stats, create a comprehensive profile of each player's on-court value.

The machine learning phase begins by splitting the matched player data into training and testing sets. The program evaluates two different algorithms: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Both models are trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20% to measure their accuracy. The system automatically selects whichever model performs best based on R² score, which typically ends up being Gradient Boosting with accuracy around 0.80-0.85. This means the model can explain about 80-85% of the variation in NBA salaries using just the performance statistics.

After training, the model analyzes feature importance to determine which statistics have the strongest influence on salary predictions. Typically, points per game carries the most weight, followed by Win Shares and EPA, with assists and True Shooting Percentage also playing significant roles. The model uses these importance weights to create a composite "Performance Metric" that scores each player on a 0-100 scale, representing their overall value based on the statistics that matter most for salary.

The program generates three professional-quality PNG visualizations that help interpret the results. The Feature Importance chart displays a horizontal bar graph showing which statistics the model weighs most heavily when predicting salaries, revealing that scoring ability and advanced metrics like Win Shares are the primary drivers of compensation. The Predictions vs Actual chart plots the model's salary predictions against the real salaries on a scatter plot, with a perfect prediction line showing where points would fall if the model were 100% accurate - most points cluster near this line, demonstrating strong model performance. The Salary vs Performance chart creates a scatter plot with salary on the x-axis and the composite performance metric on the y-axis, with a trend line showing the overall relationship and annotations highlighting the top performers, making it easy to spot players who may be underpaid or overpaid relative to their statistical production.

Interactive Predictions:
One of the most engaging features is the interactive prediction mode that activates after model training. When you choose to use this feature, the program prompts you to enter statistics for a hypothetical player: points per game, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals, True Shooting Percentage, Win Shares, and EPA. After entering all eight statistics, the model processes them through the same scaling and prediction pipeline used during training and returns a predicted salary along with a confidence interval representing the ±8% range around the prediction. This allows you to experiment with different stat combinations and understand how changes in performance metrics translate to salary differences, making the model's behavior transparent and educational.
